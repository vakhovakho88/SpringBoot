  - **Consistency**: Ensures that all developers are using the same libraries and build process.
  - **Plugins**: Extends functionality with various plugins for tasks like code analysis, testing, and deployment.

### In Simple Terms:

Maven is like a helpful assistant for Java projects. It handles the "behind-the-scenes" tasks like getting the right tools, organizing your project, and preparing it for use.

- Visit: https://start.spring.io/
- Project: Maven
- Language: Java
- Spring Boot: Latest Version, avoid snapshot versions
- Group: com.luv2code.springboot.demo
- Artifact: mycoolapp
- Add dependencies
  - Spring Web
- Click on generate and download zip project
- Open the folder with intelij and maven download dependencies
- the main class: src/main/java/com/luv2code/springboot/demo/mycoolapp/MycoolappApplication.java
- Running it will start a server and we will see on wich port it runs

Create a REST Controller

## Creating a REST Controller in Spring Boot:

### 1. Setup Spring Boot Project:

- Use **Spring Initializr** to create a new project.
- Add the `Spring Web` dependency.

### 2. Create a Controller:

- Navigate to your project's `src/main/java/com/luv2code/springboot/demo/mycoolapp` directory and create a new Package named `rest`.
- - Navigate to your project's `src/main/java/com/luv2code/springboot/demo/mycoolapp/rest` directory and create a new Class named `FunRestController`.

```java
package com.luv2code.springboot.demo.mycoolapp.rest;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class FunRestController {
    //expose "/" that return "Hello World"
    @GetMapping
    public String sayHello(){
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```

### 3. Explanation:

- `@RestController` annotation indicates that the class will serve RESTful requests.
- `@GetMapping("/")` defines an HTTP GET endpoint. When you access `http://localhost:port/`, it will return "Hello, World!".

### 4. Run & Test:

- Start your Spring Boot application.
- Use a web browser or a tool like Postman to access: `http://localhost:PORT`
- You should see: `Hello, World!`

### In Simple Terms:

This guide helps you create a simple REST endpoint in a Spring Boot application that, when accessed, returns a greeting message.

## Spring Framework Simplified

Spring Framework is like a big toolkit for Java developers. It helps them create applications more easily and efficiently. Here's a simple breakdown:

### Official Website:

- **[www.spring.io](http://www.spring.io)**: The main website where you find all things related to Spring.

### POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects):

- Just regular Java objects. No need for anything fancy.
- **Example**: A `Person` class with `name` and `age` attributes.

### Core Container:

Handles the main parts of Spring:

- **Beans**: The primary objects in your application.
  - **Example**: Think of a `Car` object in a car application.
- **Core**: The heart of Spring. It creates and manages beans.
- **SpEL**: Lets you interact with beans in advanced ways.
  - **Example**: Fetching the `Car` with the maximum speed.
- **Context**: Allows different parts of your app to communicate.

### Infrastructure:

- **AOP**: Lets you add extra features to methods without changing them.

  - **Example**: Logging every time a method is called.

- **Aspects**: Ties with AOP to enhance functionalities.
- **Instrumentation & Messaging**: Tools to monitor and send messages in applications.

### Data Access Layer:

Helps you communicate with databases:

- **JDBC**: Connects your app to databases.
  - **Example**: Fetching all users from a database.
- **ORM**: Helps you work with databases using regular objects.
  - **Example**: Saving a `User` object directly into the database.
- **Transactions**: Ensures tasks are completed properly or not at all.
  - **Example**: If buying a book fails, ensure money isn't taken.
- **OXM**: Converts objects to XML and vice versa.
- **JMS**: Lets you send and receive messages between parts of your application.

### Web Layer:

Helps in building web applications:

- **Servlet**: The foundation for building web apps in Java.
- **Websocket**: Helps in real-time communication.
  - **Example**: A live chat feature in a website.
- **Web**: Tools to make web-related tasks easier.

### Test Layer:

For checking if your application works correctly:

- **Unit**: Tests small parts of your application.
  - **Example**: Checking if the "add" function works.
- **Integration**: Tests combined parts of your application.
  - **Example**: Testing if the "buy" function reduces stock and takes money.
- **Mock**: Pretend parts for testing.
  - **Example**: Simulating a database for testing without a real one.

# **Maven Crash Course Reference**

## **Overview**

- **Maven**: A Java project management tool, focusing on dependency management and build automation.

## **Spring Boot & Maven**

- Use `start.spring.io` for Maven project generation.
- Key concepts:
  - `pom.xml`: Defines project and dependencies.
  - **Spring Boot starters**: Pre-configured templates for quick project setup in Maven.

## **Maven's Process**

1. **Manual Approach**: Download necessary JARs (like Spring, Hibernate) and manage classpath.
2. **Maven's Approach**:
   - Provide a "shopping list" of dependencies.
   - Maven fetches JARs from the Central Repository, caches locally.
   - Resolves nested dependencies automatically.

## **Building & Running with Maven**

- Maven auto-configures class and build paths, streamlining the build & run process.

## **Benefits**

- Simplifies dependency management.
- Standardized builds.
- Time-efficiency for developers.

## **Key Terms/Glossary**

- **`pom.xml`**: Project Object Model file. It defines project resources, plugins, dependencies, and other configurations.
- **Central Repository**: A remote storage of Java libraries, where Maven fetches dependencies from.
- **Local Repository**: Maven's local cache where it stores downloaded dependencies.

## **Quick-Start Example**

```xml
<!-- Sample pom.xml structure -->
<project>
   <dependencies>
      <!-- Define your dependencies here, e.g., Spring Boot Starter Web -->
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>
</project>
```

Run `mvn clean install` to fetch dependencies and build.

## **Further Resources**

- [Maven Official Documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/index.html)
- [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## **Standard Directory Structure**

Maven offers a standardized directory structure for Java projects:

- **Root Directory**: Contains the `pom.xml` file, Maven's configuration file, which details your project dependencies (akin to a shopping list).
- **src/main/java**: Where Java source code resides.
- **src/main/resources**: Houses properties and configuration files.
- **src/main/webapp**: Contains web-related assets - JSP files, config files, images, CSS, etc.
- **src/test**: For unit testing source code and related properties/config files.
- **target**: Destination directory for compiled code and Maven-generated artifacts.

## **Benefits of Using Maven**

1. **Consistency & Efficiency**:

   - Helps newcomers with a standard project layout.
   - Simplifies finding code, properties files, unit tests, etc.

2. **IDE Compatibility**:

   - Supported by major IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans).
   - Maven projects are portable across these IDEs. Develop in one IDE and open in another without hassles.

3. **Dependency Management**:

   - Maven automatically fetches required JARs.
   - Resolves missing JARs and build path/classpath issues.

4. **Rapid Onboarding**:
   - For new developers, Maven ensures a smoother entry into projects.
   - Minimal local configurations are needed. Maven fetches and sets up everything.

## **Conclusion**

Maven, once mastered, is a powerful tool for Java projects. It not only standardizes project structures but also handles dependencies and integrations seamlessly.

# **Maven Key Concepts**

## **1. POM File (Project Object Model)**

- **Definition**: Central configuration file for Maven.
- **Location**: Root of your Maven project.
- **Function**: Specifies project dependencies for Maven.

### **POM File Structure**

- **Project Metadata**: Information about the project such as its name, version, and output file type (JAR, WAR, etc.).
- **Dependencies**: List of projects your app relies on (e.g., Spring, Hibernate).
- **Plugins**: Custom tasks for activities like generating JUnit test reports.

### **Sample POM File Structure**

```xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mycoolapp</groupId>
    <artifactId>mycoolapp</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>JAR</packaging>
    <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

## **2. Project Coordinates**

- Used to uniquely identify a project.
- Comprises:
  - **Group ID**: Name of your company, group, or organization. Uses reverse domain name convention.
  - **Artifact ID**: Name of the project.
  - **Version**: Specific release version of the project.

**Tip**: Remember GAV = Group ID, Artifact ID, Version.

### **Example Project Coordinates**

For Spring:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>5.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

For Hibernate:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

## **3. Adding Dependencies**

- Directly add dependencies into the POM file.
- To find dependencies, use the project page or visit [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/).

# **Spring Boot Project Structure**

## **1. Directory Structure**

- Spring Boot uses **Maven's standard directory structure**:
  - **src/main/java**: Place for Java source code.
  - **src/main/resources**: Contains properties or config files.
  - **src/test/java**: Houses unit testing code.

## **2. Maven Wrapper (mvnw)**

- **Purpose**: Allows you to run a Maven project without requiring Maven to be installed or set on your path.
  - **mvnw.cmd**: For Microsoft Windows.
  - **mvnw.sh**: For Linux or Mac systems.
- **How It Works**: If the right version of Maven isn't on your computer, it will download and run the correct version for you.
- **Note**: If you have Maven installed, you can use the standard `mvn` command and may ignore/delete mvnw files.

## **3. POM File**

- Contains the information provided at the **Spring Initializr**.

  - **Metadata**: Group ID, artifact ID, and more.
  - **Dependencies**: Often presented as 'starters', which are collections of compatible Maven dependencies. Example: `spring-boot-starter-web`.

  **Benefits of Starters**:

  - Group related dependencies together, simplifying the POM.
  - Ensure dependencies are compatible with one another.

- **Spring Boot Maven Plugin**: Located at the bottom of the POM file, it's used to package an executable jar or create a war archive. Useful commands:
  - `mvnw package` or `mvn package`
  - `mvnw spring-boot:run` or `mvn spring-boot:run`

## **4. Source Code Overview**

- Upon project generation, a **main Spring Boot application class** is created.
- Additional classes, like **RestController**, can be created to define APIs or other functionalities.

**Tip**: Explore the `FundRestController` for a simple Rest API example.

# **Spring Boot Project Structure**

## **1. Application Properties**

- Default properties file: `application.properties`
- Located in: `src/main/resources`
- Configure Spring Boot via properties, e.g., `server.port=8585`
- Add custom properties and access them using `@Value` annotation in your classes. For example:
  ```java
  @Value("${coach.name}")
  private String coachName;
  ```

## **2. Static Content**

- Default directory: `/static`
- Types: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, PDFs, etc.
- **Warning**: Avoid `src/main/webapp` for JAR packaging. It only works for WAR.

## **3. Templates**

- Supported engines: FreeMarker, Thymeleaf, Mustache
- Default directory: `/templates`
- We'll primarily use **Thymeleaf** in the course.

## **4. Unit Tests**

- Default test class created by Spring Initializr: `Mycoolapplicationtest.java`
- Contains basic setup; you can add custom unit tests.

---

**Tips**:

1. Always use `application.properties` to configure your Spring Boot app.
2. Place static resources in the `/static` directory.
3. For dynamic content, familiarize yourself with template engines like Thymeleaf.
4. Utilize the provided test structure to create meaningful unit tests for your application.

**Key Features:**

1. **Endpoints:** Exposes various endpoints to provide insights about the running application, such as `/health`, `/info`, `/beans`, `/mappings`, etc.
2. **DevOps Ready:** Get DevOps features instantly without writing additional code.

**Setup:**

1. **Maven Dependency**:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Accessing Endpoints**: All actuator endpoints are prefixed with `/actuator`. For instance:
   - `/actuator/health`: Checks if the application is up or down.
   - `/actuator/info`: Provides application's metadata.

**Customization:**

1. **Info Endpoint**: Customize via `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   info.app.name=MyAppName
   info.app.description=My cool Spring Boot App
   info.app.version=1.0.0
   ```

2. **Exposing All Endpoints**:
   - By default, only `/health` is exposed.
   - Expose all endpoints via `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
     ```

**Security Note**: While actuator provides great insights, it's vital to ensure it's secure. You should protect these endpoints and only provide access to authorized personnel. Spring Boot provides ways to add security, covered in later modules.

**Example**:

Once you have set up the actuator, you can:

1. Navigate to `/actuator/health` in your browser. You should see a response like:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "UP"
   }
   ```

2. Navigate to `/actuator/info` to see the customized application metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "app": {
       "name": "MyAppName",
       "description": "My cool Spring Boot App",
       "version": "1.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   ```

   By simply adding this, Spring Security is enabled, and access to actuator endpoints requires authentication.

2. **Default Credentials**:

   - **Username**: `user`
   - **Password**: Found in the console logs during startup. It looks like `Using generated security password: [RANDOM PASSWORD]`.

3. **Customizing Credentials**:
   In `application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.security.user.name=scott
   spring.security.user.password=tiger
   ```

4. **Exclude Endpoints**:
   If you want to exclude specific actuator endpoints, for example `/health` and `/info`, from being exposed:
   ```properties
   management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=health,info
   ```

**Further Customizations**:

- Spring Security offers advanced configurations, allowing for user authentication via databases, incorporating roles, encrypted passwords, etc.
- For a deep dive into Spring Boot Actuator's features, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html).

## Introduction

Running Spring Boot applications from the command line is a fundamental skill that offers flexibility in development and deployment. It allows you to manage and test your applications outside of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), ensuring that your app behaves as expected in a production-like environment.

## Preparation Steps

Before running your Spring Boot application from the command line, ensure the following:

- **Maven Configuration:** Open your Maven `pom.xml` file and remove unnecessary dependencies, such as the actuator and security, to simplify the project structure for this demonstration.
- **Exit IDE:** To focus on command-line operations, close your IDE. This step ensures that your application is not running elsewhere, which could cause port conflicts.

## Running Spring Boot Apps on Windows

### Environment Setup

1. **Directory Structure:** Avoid using directories with spaces in their names to prevent issues with the Java runtime. Place your project in an easily accessible location, e.g., `D:\Users\yourusername\dev-spring-boot`.
2. **Open Command Prompt:** Use the search function to find and open `CMD`.
3. **Verify Java Installation:** Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly and that Java is installed properly by running `echo %JAVA_HOME%` and `java --version` commands.

### Packaging and Running the Application

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Use the `cd` command to move into your project's directory, e.g., `cd D:\Users\yourusername\dev-spring-boot\05-command-line-demo`.
2. **Package Application:** Execute `mvnw package` to build your application. Maven will create a `.jar` file in the `target` directory.
3. **Run Application:** Use `java -jar target\mycoolapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to start your Spring Boot application.
4. **Verify Operation:** Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to confirm that the application is running.

## Running Spring Boot Apps on macOS/Linux

The steps for macOS and Linux are similar to those for Windows, with slight differences in commands and file paths.

### Environment Setup

1. **Open Terminal:** Access the terminal through your system's utilities.
2. **Verify Java Installation:** Confirm that Java is correctly installed with `java -version` and `echo $JAVA_HOME`.

### Packaging and Running the Application

1. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Change to your project's directory, e.g., `cd ~/dev-spring-boot/05-command-line-demo`.
2. **Package Application:** Run `./mvnw package` to build your project. This creates a `.jar` file in the `target` directory.
3. **Run Application:** Start your application with `java -jar target/mycoolapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
4. **Test Application:** Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to check the application's functionality.

This guide aims to make running Spring Boot applications from the command line an accessible and straightforward process. Whether you're working in a Windows, macOS, or Linux environment, the principles remain the same, empowering you to manage your Spring Boot projects more efficiently.

# Example

Sure, I'll provide a simple example of creating a basic Spring Boot application that you can run from the command line. This application will be a minimal web service that responds with "Hello, Spring Boot!" when accessed via a web browser.

### Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

First, you'll need to set up a Spring Boot project. You can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) for this:

- **Project:** Maven Project
- **Language:** Java
- **Spring Boot:** Choose the latest stable version
- **Project Metadata:**
  - **Group:** com.example
  - **Artifact:** hello-spring-boot
- **Dependencies:** Web

Generate the project, download the ZIP file, and extract it to your workspace.

### Step 2: Add a Rest Controller

Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example/hellospringboot` directory and create a new Java file named `HelloController.java`. Add the following code:

```java
package com.example.hellospringboot;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

This code defines a REST controller with a single route (`"/"`) that returns a simple string.

### Step 3: Build the Project

Open a command line or terminal window, navigate to the root of your project, and run the Maven wrapper script to build your project:

For Windows:

```shell
mvnw package
```

For macOS/Linux:

```shell
./mvnw package
```

This command compiles your project and packages it into a `.jar` file located in the `target` directory.

### Step 4: Run the Application

After building the project, you can run the Spring Boot application using the following command:

For Windows:

```shell
java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For macOS/Linux:

```shell
java -jar target/hello-spring-boot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the message "Hello, Spring Boot!" displayed.

### Explanation

- **Spring Initializr:** A tool to quickly bootstrap a new Spring Boot project with your chosen dependencies.
- **RestController:** A Spring MVC annotation that marks the class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view. It's shorthand for including both `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
- **GetMapping:** Annotation for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods.
- **mvnw package:** A command that uses Maven Wrapper to compile your Java code, run any tests, and package the compiled code into a JAR file.
- **java -jar:** This command runs your Spring Boot application with Java, specifying the JAR file created by Maven as the program to run.

This example demonstrates the simplicity of creating and running a Spring Boot application from the command line, making it accessible for development and testing outside an IDE.

# Spring Boot Custom Application Properties Tutorial

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on utilizing custom application properties in a Spring Boot application. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to define and inject custom properties, enhancing your application's configurability and maintainability.

- [Defining Custom Application Properties](#defining-custom-application-properties)
- [Injecting Properties into Your Application](#injecting-properties-into-your-application)
- [Practical Example: Coding in Spring Boot](#practical-example-coding-in-spring-boot)
- [Common Issues and Fixes](#common-issues-and-fixes)
- [Additional Resources](#additional-resources)

## Introduction

Spring Boot simplifies the process of configuring applications by allowing developers to externalize properties. This means you can manage your application's configuration without hardcoding values, making your application adaptable to different environments.

### Key Concepts

- **application.properties**: The default file Spring Boot uses to read configuration properties.
- **@Value Annotation**: Used to inject property values into application components.

## Defining Custom Application Properties

1. **Location**: Place your `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.
2. **Syntax**: Define properties using key-value pairs. For example:
   ```properties
   coach.name=Mickey Mouse
   team.name=The Mouse Club
   ```
3. **Flexibility**: You can define any number of custom properties.

## Injecting Properties into Your Application

1. **@Value Annotation**: Use this annotation to inject properties into your Spring Boot classes.
2. **Syntax**:
   ```java
   @Value("${property.name}")
   private String propertyName;
   ```
3. **Example**:
   Injecting `coach.name` and `team.name` into a Spring Boot application.

## Practical Example: Coding in Spring Boot

### Setup

1. **Define Properties**: In `application.properties`, add your custom properties.
   ```properties
   coach.name=Mickey Mouse
   team.name=The Mouse Club
   ```

### Code Implementation

1. **Create a Rest Controller**: Use the `@RestController` annotation to define a controller.
2. **Inject Properties**: Use the `@Value` annotation to inject the defined properties.

   ```java
   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;




   @RestController
   public class FunRestController {
       @Value("${coach.name}")
       private String coachName;

       @Value("${team.name}")
       private String teamName;

       @GetMapping("/teaminfo")
       public String getTeamInfo() {
           return "Coach: " + coachName + ", Team: " + teamName;
       }
   }
   ```

### Running Your Application

- Start your Spring Boot application and access `localhost:8080/teaminfo` to see the injected properties in action.

## Common Issues and Fixes

- **Typo in Property Names**: Ensure the property names in the `@Value` annotation exactly match those in the `application.properties` file.
- **Missing Curly Braces in @Value Annotation**: Proper syntax is crucial: `@Value("${property.name}")`.

## Additional Resources

- [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.external-config)
- [Baeldung on Spring @Value](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-value-annotation)

This tutorial outlined the steps to define and inject custom application properties in a Spring Boot application. By utilizing the `application.properties` file and the `@Value` annotation, you can externalize configuration and make your application flexible and easy to configure for different environments. Remember to pay attention to the syntax and ensure your property names are consistent across your application.

# Examples

Certainly! Let's dive into two simple examples that illustrate how to define and inject custom application properties in a Spring Boot application.

### Example 1: Injecting a Simple Greeting Message

In this example, we'll configure a Spring Boot application to return a custom greeting message through a REST endpoint.

#### Step 1: Define the Property

In `src/main/resources/application.properties`, add the following property:

```properties
greeting.message=Hello, Spring Boot!
```

#### Step 2: Create a Rest Controller

Create a new Java class `GreetingController` with the following content:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    @Value("${greeting.message}")
    private String greetingMessage;

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String getGreeting() {
        return greetingMessage;
    }
}
```

This controller injects the `greeting.message` property and returns it when the `/greeting` endpoint is accessed.

### Example 2: Configuring Database Connection Details

In this second example, we'll demonstrate how to configure and inject database connection details into a Spring Boot application.

#### Step 1: Define the Properties

Add the following properties to your `application.properties` file:

```properties
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
database.username=myuser
database.password=mypassword
```

#### Step 2: Configure a DataSource Bean

Create a configuration class `DatabaseConfig` to inject these properties into a DataSource bean:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {

    @Value("${database.url}")
    private String databaseUrl;

    @Value("${database.username}")
    private String databaseUsername;

    @Value("${database.password}")
    private String databasePassword;

    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();
        dataSource.setUrl(databaseUrl);
        dataSource.setUsername(databaseUsername);
        dataSource.setPassword(databasePassword);
        return dataSource;
    }
}
```

This configuration class uses the `@Value` annotation to inject the database properties into a `DataSource` bean, configuring it with the URL, username, and password defined in `application.properties`.

### Running Your Application

For both examples, after defining your properties and creating the respective classes, run your Spring Boot application. You can then:

- For Example 1: Access `localhost:8080/greeting` in your web browser or API client to see the custom greeting message.
- For Example 2: The application won't expose a new endpoint, but the `DataSource` bean will be configured with your custom database properties, ready for use in database operations.

These examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of Spring Boot's property injection mechanism, enabling easy configuration and customization of application behavior and external resources.
