Create a REST Controller

## Creating a REST Controller in Spring Boot:

### 1. Setup Spring Boot Project:
- Use **Spring Initializr** to create a new project.
- Add the `Spring Web` dependency.

### 2. Create a Controller:

- Navigate to your project's `src/main/java/com/luv2code/springboot/demo/mycoolapp` directory and create a new Package named `rest`.
- - Navigate to your project's `src/main/java/com/luv2code/springboot/demo/mycoolapp/rest` directory and create a new Class named `FunRestController`.


```java
package com.luv2code.springboot.demo.mycoolapp.rest;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class FunRestController {
    //expose "/" that return "Hello World"
    @GetMapping
    public String sayHello(){
        return "Hello World";
    }
}
```

### 3. Explanation:

- `@RestController` annotation indicates that the class will serve RESTful requests.
- `@GetMapping("/")` defines an HTTP GET endpoint. When you access `http://localhost:port/`, it will return "Hello, World!".

### 4. Run & Test:

- Start your Spring Boot application.
- Use a web browser or a tool like Postman to access: `http://localhost:PORT`
- You should see: `Hello, World!`

### In Simple Terms:
This guide helps you create a simple REST endpoint in a Spring Boot application that, when accessed, returns a greeting message.


## Spring Framework Simplified

Spring Framework is like a big toolkit for Java developers. It helps them create applications more easily and efficiently. Here's a simple breakdown:

### Official Website:
- **[www.spring.io](http://www.spring.io)**: The main website where you find all things related to Spring.

### POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects):
- Just regular Java objects. No need for anything fancy. 
- **Example**: A `Person` class with `name` and `age` attributes.

### Core Container:
Handles the main parts of Spring:

- **Beans**: The primary objects in your application.
  - **Example**: Think of a `Car` object in a car application.

# **Maven Crash Course Reference**

## **Overview**
- **Maven**: A Java project management tool, focusing on dependency management and build automation.

## **Spring Boot & Maven**
- Use `start.spring.io` for Maven project generation.
- Key concepts:
  - `pom.xml`: Defines project and dependencies.
  - **Spring Boot starters**: Pre-configured templates for quick project setup in Maven.

## **Maven's Process**
1. **Manual Approach**: Download necessary JARs (like Spring, Hibernate) and manage classpath.
2. **Maven's Approach**: 
   - Provide a "shopping list" of dependencies.
   - Maven fetches JARs from the Central Repository, caches locally.
   - Resolves nested dependencies automatically.

## **Building & Running with Maven**
- Maven auto-configures class and build paths, streamlining the build & run process.

## **Benefits**
- Simplifies dependency management.
- Standardized builds.
- Time-efficiency for developers.

## **Key Terms/Glossary**
- **`pom.xml`**: Project Object Model file. It defines project resources, plugins, dependencies, and other configurations.
- **Central Repository**: A remote storage of Java libraries, where Maven fetches dependencies from.
- **Local Repository**: Maven's local cache where it stores downloaded dependencies.

## **Quick-Start Example**
```xml
<!-- Sample pom.xml structure -->
<project>
   <dependencies>
      <!-- Define your dependencies here, e.g., Spring Boot Starter Web -->
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>
</project>
```
Run `mvn clean install` to fetch dependencies and build.

## **Further Resources**

- [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)




## **Standard Directory Structure**

Maven offers a standardized directory structure for Java projects:

- **Root Directory**: Contains the `pom.xml` file, Maven's configuration file, which details your project dependencies (akin to a shopping list).
- **src/main/java**: Where Java source code resides.
- **src/main/resources**: Houses properties and configuration files.
- **src/main/webapp**: Contains web-related assets - JSP files, config files, images, CSS, etc.
- **src/test**: For unit testing source code and related properties/config files.
- **target**: Destination directory for compiled code and Maven-generated artifacts.

## **Benefits of Using Maven**

1. **Consistency & Efficiency**:
   - Helps newcomers with a standard project layout.
   - Simplifies finding code, properties files, unit tests, etc.

2. **IDE Compatibility**:
   - Supported by major IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans).
   - Maven projects are portable across these IDEs. Develop in one IDE and open in another without hassles.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Maven automatically fetches required JARs.
   - Resolves missing JARs and build path/classpath issues.

4. **Rapid Onboarding**:
   - For new developers, Maven ensures a smoother entry into projects.
   - Minimal local configurations are needed. Maven fetches and sets up everything.

## **Conclusion**
Maven, once mastered, is a powerful tool for Java projects. It not only standardizes project structures but also handles dependencies and integrations seamlessly.




# **Maven Key Concepts**

## **1. POM File (Project Object Model)**

- **Definition**: Central configuration file for Maven.
- **Location**: Root of your Maven project.
- **Function**: Specifies project dependencies for Maven.
  
### **POM File Structure**
- **Project Metadata**: Information about the project such as its name, version, and output file type (JAR, WAR, etc.).
- **Dependencies**: List of projects your app relies on (e.g., Spring, Hibernate).
- **Plugins**: Custom tasks for activities like generating JUnit test reports.

### **Sample POM File Structure**

```xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mycoolapp</groupId>
    <artifactId>mycoolapp</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>JAR</packaging>
    <!-- ... -->
</project>
```

## **2. Project Coordinates**

- Used to uniquely identify a project.
- Comprises:
  - **Group ID**: Name of your company, group, or organization. Uses reverse domain name convention.
  - **Artifact ID**: Name of the project.
  - **Version**: Specific release version of the project.
  
**Tip**: Remember GAV = Group ID, Artifact ID, Version.

### **Example Project Coordinates**

For Spring:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
    <version>5.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

For Hibernate:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

## **3. Adding Dependencies**

- Directly add dependencies into the POM file.
- To find dependencies, use the project page or visit [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/).









# **Spring Boot Project Structure**

## **1. Directory Structure**

- Spring Boot uses **Maven's standard directory structure**:
  - **src/main/java**: Place for Java source code.
  - **src/main/resources**: Contains properties or config files.
  - **src/test/java**: Houses unit testing code.

## **2. Maven Wrapper (mvnw)**

- **Purpose**: Allows you to run a Maven project without requiring Maven to be installed or set on your path.
  - **mvnw.cmd**: For Microsoft Windows.
  - **mvnw.sh**: For Linux or Mac systems.
- **How It Works**: If the right version of Maven isn't on your computer, it will download and run the correct version for you.
- **Note**: If you have Maven installed, you can use the standard `mvn` command and may ignore/delete mvnw files.

## **3. POM File**

- Contains the information provided at the **Spring Initializr**.
  - **Metadata**: Group ID, artifact ID, and more.
  - **Dependencies**: Often presented as 'starters', which are collections of compatible Maven dependencies. Example: `spring-boot-starter-web`.
  
  **Benefits of Starters**: 
  - Group related dependencies together, simplifying the POM.
  - Ensure dependencies are compatible with one another.
  
- **Spring Boot Maven Plugin**: Located at the bottom of the POM file, it's used to package an executable jar or create a war archive. Useful commands:
  - `mvnw package` or `mvn package` 
  - `mvnw spring-boot:run` or `mvn spring-boot:run`

## **4. Source Code Overview**

- Upon project generation, a **main Spring Boot application class** is created.
- Additional classes, like **RestController**, can be created to define APIs or other functionalities.

**Tip**: Explore the `FundRestController` for a simple Rest API example.



# **Spring Boot Project Structure**

## **1. Application Properties**

- Default properties file: `application.properties`
- Located in: `src/main/resources`
- Configure Spring Boot via properties, e.g., `server.port=8585`
- Add custom properties and access them using `@Value` annotation in your classes. For example:
  ```java
  @Value("${coach.name}")
  private String coachName;
  ```

## **2. Static Content**

- Default directory: `/static`
- Types: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, PDFs, etc.
- **Warning**: Avoid `src/main/webapp` for JAR packaging. It only works for WAR.

## **3. Templates**

- Supported engines: FreeMarker, Thymeleaf, Mustache
- Default directory: `/templates`
- We'll primarily use **Thymeleaf** in the course. 

## **4. Unit Tests**

- Default test class created by Spring Initializr: `Mycoolapplicationtest.java`
- Contains basic setup; you can add custom unit tests.

---

**Tips**:

1. Always use `application.properties` to configure your Spring Boot app.
2. Place static resources in the `/static` directory.
3. For dynamic content, familiarize yourself with template engines like Thymeleaf.
4. Utilize the provided test structure to create meaningful unit tests for your application.

**Spring Boot Actuator Quick Reference**

---

**Introduction:**
- **Spring Boot Actuator** allows you to monitor and manage your application.
  
**Key Features:**
1. **Endpoints:** Exposes various endpoints to provide insights about the running application, such as `/health`, `/info`, `/beans`, `/mappings`, etc.
2. **DevOps Ready:** Get DevOps features instantly without writing additional code.
  
**Setup:**

1. **Maven Dependency**:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Accessing Endpoints**: All actuator endpoints are prefixed with `/actuator`. For instance:
   - `/actuator/health`: Checks if the application is up or down.
   - `/actuator/info`: Provides application's metadata.

**Customization:**

1. **Info Endpoint**: Customize via `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   info.app.name=MyAppName
   info.app.description=My cool Spring Boot App
   info.app.version=1.0.0
   ```

2. **Exposing All Endpoints**: 
   - By default, only `/health` is exposed.
   - Expose all endpoints via `application.properties`:
     ```properties
     management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
     ```

**Security Note**: While actuator provides great insights, it's vital to ensure it's secure. You should protect these endpoints and only provide access to authorized personnel. Spring Boot provides ways to add security, covered in later modules.

**Example**:

Once you have set up the actuator, you can:

1. Navigate to `/actuator/health` in your browser. You should see a response like:
   ```json
   {
       "status": "UP"
   }
   ```

2. Navigate to `/actuator/info` to see the customized application metadata:
   ```json
   {
       "app": {
           "name": "MyAppName",
           "description": "My cool Spring Boot App",
           "version": "1.0.0"
       }

   By simply adding this, Spring Security is enabled, and access to actuator endpoints requires authentication.

2. **Default Credentials**:
   - **Username**: `user`
   - **Password**: Found in the console logs during startup. It looks like `Using generated security password: [RANDOM PASSWORD]`.

3. **Customizing Credentials**:
   In `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.security.user.name=scott
   spring.security.user.password=tiger
   ```

4. **Exclude Endpoints**:
   If you want to exclude specific actuator endpoints, for example `/health` and `/info`, from being exposed:
   ```properties
   management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=health,info
   ```

**Further Customizations**:
- Spring Security offers advanced configurations, allowing for user authentication via databases, incorporating roles, encrypted passwords, etc.

     - No separate server or IDE needed.
     - Use `java -jar <JARFileName>` to start the app.

3. **Using Spring Boot Maven Plugin:**
   - Example: Run the app using `mvnw spring-boot:run`.
   - Key Points: 
     - Simplifies running Spring Boot apps.
     - No manual Maven installation required.
     - Can also use `mvn spring-boot:run` if Maven is installed.

4. **Packaging and Running:**
   - Example: Package the app with `mvnw package`.
   - Key Points: 
     - Use `mvnw spring-boot:run` to run it.
     - Mention `pom.xml` configuration for Spring Boot Maven Plugin.

5. **Development Workflow:**
   - Key Points: 
     - Demonstrate exiting the IDE.
     - Show how to package and run using both `java-jar` and Spring Boot Maven Plugin.
